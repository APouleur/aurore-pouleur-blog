| General topic                      | Scientists found how to couple methylation enzymes to their methylation pattern. This discover is really important for gene  engineering.                                                                                                                                               |
| Procedure/ what was examined       | By coupling DNA-rings (plasmids) containing one of the methyltransferases and  "cassettes" full of certain DNA patterns (“motifs”), because DNA-patterns are the targets for methyltransferases, the methyltransferase (expressed by the plasmid) will mark the DNA in a specific way. |
| Conclusions/   discovery           | Scientists found how to couple methylation enzymes to their methylation pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Remaining   questions              | The activity to specific methyltransferases gene is not yet coupled for 1 of the 12 motifs.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
